🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project was created as Task 2 during my internship at SkillCraftTechnology. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival, visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

📁 Dataset
- Source: Titanic Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Files Used: train.csv

📊 Visualizations Included
1. Age Distribution of Passengers  
   - Type: Histogram  
   - Insight: Distribution of passengers by age

2. Survival Rate by Gender  
   - Type: Stacked Column / Donut Chart  
   - Insight: Gender-wise survival comparison

3. Survival by Passenger Class
   - Type: Stacked Column  
   - Insight: Class-wise survival rate

4. Age vs Survival 
   - Type: Box Plot  
   - Insight: Age range among survivors and non-survivors

5. Fare Distribution by Class
   - Type: Box Plot  
   - Insight: Fare patterns across classes
     
6. Survival by Embarked Location
   - Type: Column Chart  
   - Insight: Port-wise survival trends

🧩 Slicers Added
- Gender (Sex)
- Survived

📌 Dashboard Title
**Titanic Survival Analysis Dashboard**

🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI – for visualization and dashboard building  
- Excel – for basic preprocessing  
- DAX – for creating custom measures and columns  

💡 What I Learned
- Data cleaning and transformation in Power BI  
- Using DAX for calculated columns and dynamic visuals  
- Designing clean and interactive dashboards  
- Gaining insights by comparing multiple variables

 ✅ Project Status
✔️ Completed (Task 2 of Internship at SkillCraftTechnology)
